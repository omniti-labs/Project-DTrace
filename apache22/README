The apr-util-hook-probes patch is a header-only patch to apr-util that
introduces optional DTrace probes into hook definitions:
   hook-entry
      foreach registration:
        hook-dispatch-invoke
        (call)
        hook-dispatch-complete
   hook-return

Apply this to apr-utils (or patch the installed apr_hooks.h file)


The apache-2.2.x-probes patch is all the leg work to add dtrace probes into
Apache 2.2.x branch.  They will apply to the 2.2.8 distribution
successfully (with fuzz).

The apache-2.2.8-probes patch fixes up the files in the 2.2.8 distro
that aren't in trunk.  These are the products of buildconf:
   configure
   include/ap_auto_config.h.in

Apply both of these (in any order), then add --enable-dtrace to the
configure line.

It is highly likely that these patches are unclean for non-dtrace use.
That means, applying the patch and then not using --enable-dtrace may result
in a failure to build.

Also, the dtrace -G usage is hard-coded in, so this will not work on Mac OS X
without a bit of manual touchup.
